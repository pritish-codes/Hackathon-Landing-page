Hackathon Landing Page
This is a mini project using Html CSS and bootstrap 5. The structure of the website was primarily made using bootstrap framework.
I used font-awsome library for small logos and icons.
The design and content is inspired by hackoff website.

I have to make a few changes in this. 
1)I want to add a preloader
2)I want to add a Particle backround using particle.js
3)I want to add animations using rellax.js library
I wasnt able to complete these changes due to time constraint but i will complete them as soon as possible.
